Installation & Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To install and run this software requires:

* qt5
* gcc
* gawk
* iptables - Commands for setup Linux's low level network filtering.
* Linux

Read the file called INSTALL for generic instructions about using cmake to install software.

Post-build setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After running 'make install', a few more steps are needed to correctly install Guidedog.

The Guidedog script at /etc/rc.guidedog needs to be run each time that
a network interface goes up (enabled) or down (disabled). Mandrake 9.1,
and I think the current RedHat (now is 8 may 2003) and hopefully others,
have two directories:

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup.d
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifdown.d

These work much like /etc/rc.d/*. Any scripts (or symbol links to scripts)
get executed when a network interface goes up or down. So to have Guidedog
run we can add some links. First make sure that a file exits at
/etc/rc.guidedog . Run the command (as root):

    echo "#!/bin/sh" > /etc/rc.guidedog

Now create some links in the ifup.d and ifdown.d directories:

    /bin/ln -s /etc/rc.guidedog /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup.d/20Guidedog
    /bin/ln -s /etc/rc.guidedog /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifdown.d/20Guidedog

When a network interface goes up/down the Guidedog script should run. You can
check you boot message logs and look for a message from Guidedog.
    
Needless to say, but if you can use a prepackaged Guidedog for your Linux distribution then do so.
    
good luck,
